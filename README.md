## Benefits 

Doing work outside modules will set you apart from those who are only good in academic work and will increase your chances of getting,

* paid internships in our OSS projects (more info [below](#paid-internships))
*	good internship offers from other companies for SIP/ATAP
*	entry to selection-based modules such as CS3281&2, CS3216, CS3217
*	CS2103 tutorships

## How to get started

Each of the projects have their own documentation on how to get started. 

If you have limited experience outside project in school modules, you can start with a smaller project such as those in [SE-EDU](https://github.com/se-edu) or [CS2103 website](https://github.com/nus-cs2103/website) and move to bigger projects after a while. 

Vacations are especially good times to get started on our projects as our projects are more active during those times. We even have dedicated working space in school for those working on our projects during vacation times.

## Paid internships

For NUS students, it is possible to get paid for work done in these projects. 
* Part time internships : Pay depends on the amount of work, $8.74/hour + CPF
* Full time internships : $1200-$1500 per month. These internships are eligible for SIP and ATAP credit.
* [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) : Our projects have taken part in GSoC 2014 (4 internships), 2015 (6 internships), 2016 (7 internships). 

After you have contributed a few PRs any of the projects above, contact project mentor [Dr Damith](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~damithch) to explore the possibilities for paid internships.
